1. Implement more realistic materials: In the Phong lighting model, the diffuse and specular coefficients of a material are constants that determine how much light is reflected from the surface. In reality, these coefficients can vary depending on the surface roughness, the angle of incidence of the light, and other factors. You can implement more realistic materials by using a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) that models these variations.

2. Use more complex light sources: In the Phong lighting model, light sources are modeled as simple point sources with a fixed intensity and color. In reality, light sources can be more complex, such as spotlights, area lights, and environment maps. You can implement these light sources to produce more realistic lighting in your raytracer.

3. Implement global illumination: The Phong lighting model only considers direct lighting from light sources. It does not take into account indirect lighting, which is the light that is reflected off other surfaces in the scene before reaching the viewer. You can implement global illumination techniques, such as path tracing or Monte Carlo integration, to approximate indirect lighting in your raytracer.

5. Implement acceleration structures: To improve the performance of your raytracer, you can implement acceleration structures such as k-d trees or BVHs (bounding volume hierarchies) to more efficiently find the intersection points of rays with objects in the scene.
